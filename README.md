# Docker Image for XYZ Analysis

This Docker image provides an environment for performing XYZ analysis. It includes all the necessary dependencies and tools.

## Build

To build the Docker image, navigate to the directory containing the Dockerfile and run the following command:

docker build -t xyz-analysis .


## Run

To run the Docker image, use the following command:

docker run --rm xyz-analysis



This will execute the analysis pipeline inside the Docker container. Make sure to mount any necessary input files or directories to the container using the `-v` option.

## Memory Allocation

The recommended memory allocation for running this Docker image is at least 4GB. Depending on the size of the input data and the complexity of the analysis, you may need to allocate more memory.

To allocate more memory, use the `-m` flag when running the Docker container:

docker run --rm -m 8g xyz-analysis



This will allocate 8GB of memory to the container.

## Execution Time

The execution time of the analysis pipeline depends on various factors, including the size of the input data and the complexity of the analysis. It is difficult to provide an exact estimate without specific details.

However, as a rough estimate, the analysis pipeline typically takes around X hours to complete. Please note that this is just an estimate and the actual execution time may vary.
